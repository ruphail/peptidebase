# PeptideDB

A comprehensive database for antimicrobial peptides, designed to accelerate research in fighting antibiotic resistance.

This project exists to merge the existing AMP databases that are currently scattered around the internet:
- APD3
- CAMPR3
- DBAASP v3
- Defensins knowledgebase
- BaAMPs
- BACTIBASE
- DADP
- DRAMP
- Peptaibol
- LAMP
- YADAMP
- PhytAMP
- InverPep
- HIPdb
- Thiobase
- EnzyBase
- ParaPep
- dbAMP
- AntiTbPdb

Permission and licenses still need to obtained for many of these datasets before this can launch.

## Features

- Searchable database of peptide sequences
- Experimental data tracking
- Machine learning model integration
- Visualization tools
- API access

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/peptidedb.git
   cd peptidedb
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```

3. Copy .env.example to .env and update the variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
